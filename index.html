          <p>
            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the
            seeds of berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus.
            From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable,
            raw product: unroasted green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a
            process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted
            coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically
            steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of
            coffee. Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a
            stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine
            content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and
            can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso,
            French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is
            usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
            Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the
            bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee
            cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts. A commercial
            establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a
            coffeehouse or coffee shop (not to be confused with Dutch
            coffeeshops selling cannabis).

          <h1>DIFFERENT TYPES OF COFFEE</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you can't imagine life without coffee, you're not alone: Ree
            Drummond starts every day with a cup. (She loves it so much that she
            just launched The Pioneer Woman coffee line!) There are so many
            popular types of coffee to choose from, but for Ree, cold brew is
            the way to go. She mastered the art of making perfect cold-brewed
            iced coffee at home years ago, and these days she gets growlers of
            the stuff from her Pawhuska, OK, shop and restaurant The Mercantile,
            so she can have a tall glass every morning. "To say I couldn't live
            without it is an understatement," she says. Her obsession is on full
            display at The Merc's café, which serves a bunch of different types
            of coffee drinks: cold brew, of course, as well as espresso-based
            drinks like cortados, cappuccinos, macchiatos, and more. Coffee is a
            brewed drink made from coffee beans, which are actually the roasted
            seeds of the coffee plant. The species of bean used, where it was
            sourced from, and how it was roasted will all affect the taste and
            aroma of the final cup you'll sip. The two main categories of coffee
            beans you'll come across are Arabica and Robusta.

          <h4>Expresso</h4>
          <p>
            When beans are used to make espresso they're more finely ground, and
            they're brewed with a higher ground s-to-water ratio than what's
            used for coffee. The result is a thicker, more concentrated liquid
            with a bolder flavor.

          <h4>Cold Brew</h4>
          <p>
            Cold brew is one of the biggest coffee trends of the last decade,
            and for good reason: It's made by slowly steeping coffee grounds
            over cool or room-temperature water, so it tastes smoother and less
            bitter than regular iced coffee, which is brewed hot.
